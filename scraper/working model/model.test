__label__Tree __label__Data-Structures Greg has a tree of nodes containing integer data.  He wants to insert a node with some non-zero integer value somewhere into the tree.  His goal is to be able to cut two edges and have the values of each of the three new trees sum to the same amount.  This is called a balanced forest.  Being frugal, the data value he inserts should be minimal.  Determine the minimal amount that a new node can have to allow creation of a balanced forest.  If it's not possible to create a balanced forest, return -1. For example, you are given node values  and .  It is the following tree:     The blue node is root, the first number in a node is node number and the second is its value.  Cuts can be made between nodes  and  and nodes  and  to have three trees with sums ,  and .  Adding a new node  of  to the third tree completes the solution.   Function Description Complete the balancedForest function in the editor below.  It must return an integer representing the minimum value of  that can be added to allow creation of a balanced forest, or  if it is not possible.   balancedForest has the following parameter(s): c: an array of integers, the data values for each node   edges: an array of 2 element arrays, the node pairs per edge   Input Format The first line contains a single integer, , the number of queries.

__label__Hash-Table __label__Depth-first-Search You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and his direct subordinates' id. For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct. Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates. Example 1: Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1 Output: 11 Explanation: Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.    Note:  One employee has at most one direct leader and may have several subordinates. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.
__label__Dynamic-Programming A war has broken down between Vim and Emacs. Gedit, being Vim's ally, is captured by Emacs as a prisoner of war and it is up to Vim to rescue him by defeating Emacs. For this task, Vim has to assemble an army of appropriate skills. He can choose a non-empty subset of soldiers from a set of  soldiers (numbered from  to ). Each soldier has some subset of skills out of  different skills (numbered from  to ). The skill-set of an army is the union of skill-sets of its constituent soldiers. To win the war, Vim needs to know how many different subsets of soldiers satisfy his skill-set requirement. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo .  Note : The chosen army's skill-set must exactly match the skill-set requirement of Vim (i.e no extra skills must be present in the army's skill-set than what is required). Input Format The first line contains  and , the number of soldiers to choose from and the number of different skills possible respectively.  The next  lines contain  boolean characters each. If the  character of the  line is , then the  soldier possess the  skill and if it is , then not.  The last line contains  boolean characters denoting the requirement skill-set of Vim where the  character being  signifies that Vim wants the  skill to be present in his final army and not, otherwise.

__label__Game-Theory __label__Game-Theory Alice and Bob are playing a game, defined below: There is an undirected tree graph with  nodes that has the following properties:  Each node has  golden coins.  Node  is root of the tree.  The parent node of some node  is defined as . Each node has  golden coins.  Node  is root of the tree.  The parent node of some node  is defined as . Moves Players move in turns.  During a move, a player can select a node  and move one or more coins to .  If the current player can't make any move, they lose the game. Players move in turns.  During a move, a player can select a node  and move one or more coins to .  If the current player can't make any move, they lose the game. The game quickly becomes boring because the result is determined by the tree's configuration and the number of coins in each node (assuming that both players play optimally). Alice decides to instead challenge Bob by asking him  questions. For each question : Alice picks a node  and removes the edge between  and .  She picks another node  and draws a new undirected edge between  and . So now . Bob must determine if the first player has a winning strategy for the new tree or not. It's possible that after Alice draws the new edge, the graph will no longer be a tree; if that happens, the question is invalid. Each question is independent, so the answer depends on the initial state of the graph (and not on previous questions). Given the tree and the number of coins in each node, can you help Bob answer all  questions? Input Format The first line contains an integer,  (the number of nodes).  The second line contains  space-separated integers, , describing the number of coins in each node.  Each of the  subsequent lines contains  space-separated integers denoting an undirected edge between nodes  and , respectively.

Constraints    For each question:    Output Format On a new line for each question, print  if the first player has a winning strategy, print  if they do not, or print  if the question is not valid. Sample Input 6 0 2 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 4 6 3 6 2 4 1 3 6  Sample Output NO YES INVALID  Explanation Initally the tree looks like this:  After the first question (), the tree looks like this:  Alice removes the edge conecting node  to  and makes  the new parent node of . Because this configuration does not result in a winning strategy, we print  on a new line. After the second question (), the tree looks like this:  Alice removes the edge conecting node  to  and makes  the new parent node of . Because this configuration results in a winning strategy, we print  on a new line. After the third question (), the graph is no longer a tree:  Alice removes the edge conecting node  to  and makes  the new parent node of . The graph is now partitioned into two separate subgraphs (one of which is also not a tree); because the game must be played on a single undirected tree graph, we print  on a new line.

__label__Game-Theory Chess is a very popular game played by hundreds of millions of people. Nowadays, we have chess engines such as Stockfish and Komodo to help us analyze games. These engines are very powerful pieces of well-developed software that use intelligent ideas and algorithms to analyze positions and sequences of moves, as well as to find tactical ideas. Consider the following simplified version of chess: Board:  It's played on a  board between two players named Black and White. Rows are numbered from  to , where the top row is  and the bottom row is .   Columns are lettered from  to , where the leftmost column is  and the rightmost column is . It's played on a  board between two players named Black and White. Rows are numbered from  to , where the top row is  and the bottom row is .   Columns are lettered from  to , where the leftmost column is  and the rightmost column is . Pieces and Movement:  White initially has  pieces and Black initially has  pieces. There are no Kings on the board. Each player initially has exactly  Queen, at most  Pawns, at most  Rooks, and at most  minor pieces (i.e., a Bishop and/or Knight). White's Pawns move up the board, while Black's Pawns move down the board. Each move made by any player counts as a single move. Each piece's possible moves are the same as in classical chess, with the following exceptions: Pawns cannot move two squares forward. The en passant move is not possible. Promotion: Pawns promote to either a Bishop, Knight, or Rook when they reach the back row (promotion to a Queen is not allowed).  The players must perform promotions whenever possible. This means White must promote their Pawns when they reach any cell in the top row, and Black must promote their Pawns when they reach any cell in the bottom row.

Shaka is a newcomer in Chile and is trying to start his own business. He is planning to build a store. He has his own ideas for the "perfect store" which can be represented by a HxW grid. Element at position (i, j) represents height of land at index (i, j) in the grid.   Shaka has purchased a land area which can be represented RxC grid (H <= R, W <= C). Shaka is interested in finding best HxW sub-grid in the acquired land. In order to compare the possible sub-grids, Shaka will be using the sum of squared difference between each cell of his "perfect store" and  it's corresponding cell in the subgrid. Amongst all possible sub-grids, he will choose the one with smallest such sum. Note The grids are 1-indexed and rows increase from top to bottom and columns increase from left to right.  If x is the height of a cell in the "perfect store" and y is the height of the corresponding cell in a sub-grid of the acquired land, then the squared difference is defined as (x-y)2  Input Format The first line of the input consists of two integers, R C, separated by single space.  Then R lines follow, each one containing C space separated integers, which describe the height of each land spot of the purchased land.

Explained here If the answer is no less than , output the answer % .  (If the answer is less than , keep adding  until the value turns non negative.) Input Format  The first line of input file contains an integer, , denoting the number of test cases to follow.  Each testcase comprises of  lines.  The first line contains , the number of integers.  The second line contains two space separated integers, alpha and beta.  The third line contains space separated  integers_, denoting the  integer in array .   Output Format  Output  lines. Each line contains the answer to its respective test case.  Constraints          Sample Input Sample Output Explanation There are  test cases in total.  For the first test case, only  BST can be formed with 1 as the root node. Hence the Liking / sum is .  For the first test case, only  BST can be formed with 1 as the root node. Hence the Liking / sum is .  1 For the second test case, we get 2 BSTs of the form, the Liking of the first tree is  and , this sums to , hence the answer.  For the second test case, we get 2 BSTs of the form, the Liking of the first tree is  and , this sums to , hence the answer.  For the third test case, we get  BSTs. The Liking of each of the BST from left  to right are  which sums to  and hence the answer.   Similarly, for the fourth test case, the answer is .
__label__Array __label__Dynamic-Programming In a given array nums of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum. Each subarray will be of size k, and we want to maximize the sum of all 3*k entries. Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one. Example: Input: [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2 Output: [0, 3, 5] Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5]. We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.    Note:  nums.length will be between 1 and 20000. nums[i] will be between 1 and 65535. k will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).
__label__Array __label__Two-Pointers Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.    The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.    Example: Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49
__label__Tree __label__Data-Structures You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and values to be inserted into the tree. Insert the values into their appropriate position in the binary search tree and return the root of the updated binary tree. You just have to complete the function.

__label__Strings Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:  The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's. Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.  Given a special string S, a move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of S, and swapping them.  (Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)  At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?  Example 1: Input: S = "11011000" Output: "11100100" Explanation: The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped. This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.   Note: S has length at most 50. S is guaranteed to be a special binary string as defined above.
__label__Game-Theory __label__Game-Theory Big Cat and Little Cat love playing games. Today, they decide to play a Game of Stones, the Kitties are Coming edition. The game's rules are as follows:  The game starts with  stones that are randomly divided into  piles.  The cats move in alternating turns, and Little Cat always moves first. During a move, a cat picks a pile having a number of stones  and splits it into any number of non-empty piles in the inclusive range from  to .  The first cat to be unable to make a move (e.g., because all piles contain exactly  stone) loses the game.  Little Cat is curious about the number of ways in which the stones can be initially arranged so that she is guaranteed to win. Two arrangements of stone piles are considered to be different if they contain different sequences of values. For example, arrangements  and  are different. Given the values for , , and , find the number of winning configurations for Little Cat and print it modulo .  Note: Each cat always moves optimally, meaning that they're both playing to win and neither cat will make a move that causes them to lose the game if some other (winning) sequence of moves can be made. Input Format The first line of input contains three space-separated integers,  (the number of stones),  (the number of piles), and  (the maximum number of piles into which a pile can be split during a single move), respectively. Constraints    Output Format Print the number of initial arrangements of piles that will result in Little Cat winning, modulo . Sample Input 4 3 3  Sample Output 3  Explanation There are three possible arrangements:    For any arrangement, Little Cat can pick a pile containing  stones and split it into  piles with  stone each. At this point, the pile configuration will be , so Big Cat won't be able to make any moves and the game ends. We then print the result of  on a new line.

Sample Input 5 5 4 3 4 5  Sample Output 8  Explanation We can compute the following:          The largest of these is 8, so it is the answer.
__label__Tree Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).  For example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     3    / \   9  20     /  \    15   7    return its level order traversal as: [   [3],   [9,20],   [15,7] ]
__label__Strings Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.  Example: Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2 Output: "bacdfeg"   Restrictions:   The string consists of lower English letters only.  Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]
__label__Dynamic-Programming A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. For example, these are arithmetic sequences: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 7, 7, 7, 7 3, -1, -5, -9 The following sequence is not arithmetic. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7    A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A subsequence slice of that array is any sequence of integers (P0, P1, ..., Pk) such that 0 ≤ P0 < P1 < ... < Pk < N. A subsequence slice (P0, P1, ..., Pk) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence A[P0], A[P1], ..., A[Pk-1], A[Pk] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that k ≥ 2. The function should return the number of arithmetic subsequence slices in the array A. The input contains N integers. Every integer is in the range of -231 and 231-1 and 0 ≤ N ≤ 1000. The output is guaranteed to be less than 231-1.    Example: Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  Output: 7  Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are: [2,4,6] [4,6,8] [6,8,10] [2,4,6,8] [4,6,8,10] [2,4,6,8,10] [2,6,10]
__label__Strings Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.  The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers. Example 1: Input: "123" Output: "121"   Note:  The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18. If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
__label__Data-Structures __label__Advanced-Data-Structures You are given a rooted tree with N nodes and the root of the tree, R, is also given. Each node of the tree contains a value, that is initially empty. You have to mantain the tree under two operations: Update Operation Report Operation Update Operation  Each Update Operation begins with the character U. Character U is followed by 3 integers T, V and K. For every node which is the descendent of the node T, update it's value by adding V + d*K, where V and K are the parameters of the query and d is the distance of the node from T.

Each of the next N-1 lines contains 2 space separated integers, X and Y (X and Y are connected by an edge). Thereafter, E lines follows: each line can represent either the Update Operation or the Report Operation. Update Operation is of the form : U T V K. Report Operation is of the form : Q A B.

__label__Array __label__Strings Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2. Now, given string arrays queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.   Example 1: Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"] Output: [1] Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").  Example 2: Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"] Output: [1,2] Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").    Constraints:  1 <= queries.length <= 2000 1 <= words.length <= 2000 1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10 queries[i][j], words[i][j] are English lowercase letters.
__label__Dynamic-Programming Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:  You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again). After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)  Example: Input: [1,2,3,0,2] Output: 3  Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
__label__Strings We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency. For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not. bacdc dcbac bacdc dcbad Alice is taking a cryptography class and finding anagrams to be very useful. She decides on an encryption scheme involving two large strings where encryption is dependent on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. Can you help her find this number?  Given two strings,  and , that may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make  and  anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.  For example,  and .  The only characters that match are the 's so we have to remove  from  and  from  for a total of  deletions.   Function Description  Complete the makingAnagrams function in the editor below.  It should return an integer representing the minimum number of deletions needed to make the strings anagrams.   makingAnagrams has the following parameter(s):   s1: a string   s2: a string   Input Format The first line contains a single string, .  The second line contains a single string, . Constraints   It is guaranteed that  and  consist of lowercase English letters, ascii[a-z].

Sample Input cde abc  Sample Output 4  Explanation We delete the following characters from our two strings to turn them into anagrams of each other: Remove d and e from cde to get c. d e cde c Remove a and b from abc to get c. a b abc c We had to delete  characters to make both strings anagrams.
__label__Search Numeros the Artist had two lists that were permutations of one another.  He was very proud. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were lost out of the first list. Can you find the missing numbers? As an example, the array with some numbers missing, .  The original array of numbers .  The numbers missing are .   Notes  If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is not the case, then it is also a missing number.  You have to print all the missing numbers in ascending order.  Print each missing number once, even if it is missing multiple times.  The difference between maximum and minimum number in the second list is less than or equal to .   Function Description  Complete the missingNumbers function in the editor below.  It should return a sorted array of missing numbers.   missingNumbers has the following parameter(s): arr: the array with missing numbers    brr: the original array of numbers    Input Format There will be four lines of input:    - the size of the first list,    The next line contains  space-separated integers    - the size of the second list,    The next line contains  space-separated integers   Constraints       Output Format Output the missing numbers in ascending order.

__label__Strings To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size). Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing. For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with "ffff". Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'. All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case. Example 1: Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["a","cd"], targets = ["eee","ffff"] Output: "eeebffff" Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee". "cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".  Example 2: Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"] Output: "eeecd" Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".  "ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.  Notes:  0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100 0 < indexes[i] < S.length <= 1000 All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters.

For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another. Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length. You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

__label__Array In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty.  There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting. Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.  Return that maximum distance to closest person.  Example 1: Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1] Output: 2 Explanation:  If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2. If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1. Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.  Example 2: Input: [1,0,0,0] Output: 3 Explanation:  If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away. This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.  Note:  1 <= seats.length <= 20000 seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.

__label__Dynamic-Programming __label__Strings Megan is playing a string game with the following rules: It starts with a string, . During each turn, she performs the following move: Choose an index in . The chosen index must be strictly greater than any index chosen in a prior move.  Perform one or more circular rotations (in either direction) of the suffix starting at the chosen index. For example, let's say  abcdefjghi. During our move, we choose to do three right rotations of the suffix starting at index :    Note that this counts as one move. During each turn, she performs the following move: Choose an index in . The chosen index must be strictly greater than any index chosen in a prior move.  Perform one or more circular rotations (in either direction) of the suffix starting at the chosen index. For example, let's say  abcdefjghi. During our move, we choose to do three right rotations of the suffix starting at index :    Note that this counts as one move. abcdefjghi The goal of the game is to convert  into the lexicographically smallest possible string in as few moves as possible. In other words, we want the characters to be in alphabetical order. Megan plays this game  times, starting with a new string  each time. For each game, find the minimum number of moves necessary to convert  into the lexicographically smallest string and print that number on a new line. Input Format The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of games.  Each of the  subsequent lines contains a single string denoting the initial value of string  for a game. Constraints    consists of lowercase English alphabetic letters only. Output Format For each game, print an integer on a new line denoting the minimum number of moves required to convert  into the lexicographically smallest string possible. Sample Input 0 Sample Output 0 Explanation 0 We play the following  games: In the first game, abcdefghij is already as lexicographically small as possible (each sequential letter is in alphabetical order). Because we don't need to perform any moves, we print  on a new line. abcdefghij In the second game, we rotate the suffix starting at index , so acab becomes aabc. Because the string is lexicographically smallest after one move, we print  on a new line. acab aabc In the third game, we perform the following moves: Rotate the suffix starting at index  (i.e., the entire string), so baba becomes abab.  Rotate the suffix starting at index , so abab becomes aabb. Because the string is lexicographically smallest after two moves, we print  on a new line. In the third game, we perform the following moves: Rotate the suffix starting at index  (i.e., the entire string), so baba becomes abab.  baba abab Rotate the suffix starting at index , so abab becomes aabb. abab aabb Because the string is lexicographically smallest after two moves, we print  on a new line.

__label__Dynamic-Programming Superman has been invited to India to celebrate Diwali. Unfortunately, on his arrival he learns that he has been invited mainly to help rescue people from a fire accident that has happened in a posh residential locale of New Delhi, where rescue is proving to be especially difficult. As he reaches the place of the fire, before him there are  buildings, each of the same height , which are on fire. Since it is Diwali, some floors of the buildings are empty as the occupants have gone elsewhere for celebrations. In his hurry to start the rescue Superman reaches the top of the building, but realizes that his jumping power is depleted and restricted due to change in his geographical setting. He soon understands the restrictions of his jumping power, and they are as follows:  He can use the jumping power any number of times until he reaches the bottom floor, which means he can use the jumping power only until before he reaches the bottom (Ground floor), which means, once he reaches the bottom floor, he cannot move to the top floor again and try to save people. (In one single drop from the top to bottom) He can use the jumping power any number of times until he reaches the bottom floor, which means he can use the jumping power only until before he reaches the bottom (Ground floor), which means, once he reaches the bottom floor, he cannot move to the top floor again and try to save people. (In one single drop from the top to bottom) While switching buildings, he loses height  while jumping. While switching buildings, he loses height  while jumping. The second restriction is explained below with an example. Assume . Now Superman is in the 2nd building 5th floor (, ). If he wants to switch to the fifth building (), he will lose height (), which means he will be at floor 3 at building 5 (, ). He can jump freely from the current floor to the floor below on the same building . That is, suppose if he is at , he can go to  without any restrictions. He cannot skip a floor while jumping in the same building. He can go to the floor below the current floor of the same building or use his jumping power, switch building, and lose height . Given the information about the occupied floors in each of the  buildings, help Superman to determine the maximum number of people he can save in one single drop from the top to the bottom floor with the given restrictions. Input Format Input starts with three values:  the number of buildings , the height of the buildings , and the height Superman will lose when he switches buildings . These are followed by  lines. Each  line starts with a non negative integer  indicating how many people are in the th building. Each of the following  integers indicates that a person is at height  in the  buiding. Each of the following  integers are given and repetitions are allowed which means there can be more than one person in a floor.  indicates building number and  indicates floor number. Building number will not be given; since  lines follow the first line, you can assume that the  line indicates the  building's specifications. Constraints       (for each , which means the maximum number of people in a particular building will not exceed )   Output Format Output the maximum number of people Superman can save. Sample Input 4 15 2  5 1 1 1 4 10 8 9 5 7 7 3 9 8 8 5 9 5 6 4 3 0     Sample Output 12  Explanation Input starts with , ,  .  lines follow. Each line describes building . Each line begins with , which denotes the number of persons in a particular building, followed by floor number, where each person resides. Floor number can repeat as any number of people can reside on a particular floor.   I've attached a figure here to explain the sample test case.   You can verify the first building's specifications with the figure.   (Total number of persons in the first building), followed by 1 1 1 4 10(Floor numbers).   floor = 3 persons.  floor = 1 person.  floor = 1 person.  Similarly, the specifications for the other three buildings follow.  The connected line shows the path which Superman can use to save the maximum number of people. In this case, that number is . You can also note in the figure that when he switches from Building 2 to Building 3, he loses height  (). Similarly, when he switches from Building 3 to Building 1 ,the same height loss happens as mentioned in the problem statement.
__label__Tree __label__Data-Structures The square-ten tree decomposition of an array is defined as follows: The lowest () level of the square-ten tree consists of single array elements in their natural order.

Thus, the  level contains subsegments of length , the  level contains subsegments of length , the  level contains subsegments of length , etc. In other words, every  level (for every ) of square-ten tree consists of array subsegments indexed as:    The image below depicts the bottom-left corner (i.e., the first  array elements) of the table representing a square-ten tree. The levels are numbered from bottom to top:  Task  Given the borders of array subsegment , find its decomposition into a minimal number of nodes of a square-ten tree. In other words, you must find a subsegment sequence  such as  for every , , , where every  belongs to any of the square-ten tree levels and  is minimal amongst all such variants. Input Format The first line contains a single integer denoting .  The second line contains a single integer denoting . Constraints  The numbers in input do not contain leading zeroes. Output Format As soon as array indices are too large, you should find a sequence of  square-ten tree level numbers, , meaning that subsegment  belongs to the  level of the square-ten tree.  Print this sequence in the following compressed format:  On the first line, print the value of  (i.e., the compressed sequence block count).  For each of the  subsequent lines, print  space-separated integers,  and  (, ), meaning that the number  appears consequently  times in sequence . Blocks should be listed in the order they appear in the sequence. In other words,  should be equal to ,  should be equal to , etc. Thus  must be true and  must be true for every . All numbers should be printed without leading zeroes. Sample Input 0 Sample Output 0 Explanation 0 Segment  belongs to level  of the square-ten tree.

Note:  Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.  Example: Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [1,2] Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
__label__Mathematics __label__Dynamic-Programming Given a single positive integer x, we will write an expression of the form x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ... where each operator op1, op2, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (+, -, *, or /).  For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3. When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:  The division operator (/) returns rational numbers. There are no parentheses placed anywhere. We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happens before addition and subtraction. It's not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-).  For example, "x - x" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "-x + x" is not because it uses negation.  We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target.  Return the least number of operators used.    Example 1: Input: x = 3, target = 19 Output: 5 Explanation: 3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3.  The expression contains 5 operations.  Example 2:  Input: x = 5, target = 501 Output: 8 Explanation: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5.  The expression contains 8 operations.   Example 3: Input: x = 100, target = 100000000 Output: 3 Explanation: 100 * 100 * 100 * 100.  The expression contains 3 operations.      Note:  2 <= x <= 100 1 <= target <= 2 * 10^8

__label__Search We take a line segment of length  on a one-dimensional plane and bend it to create a circle with circumference  that's indexed from  to . For example, if :  We denote a pair of points,  and , as . We then plot  pairs of points (meaning a total of  individual points) at various indices along the circle's circumference. We define the distance  between points  and  in pair  as . Next, let's consider two pairs:  and . We define distance  as the minimum of the six distances between any two points among points , , , and . In other words:    For example, consider the following diagram in which the relationship between points in pairs at non-overlapping indices is shown by a connecting line:  Given  pairs of points and the value of , find and print the maximum value of , where , among all pairs of points. Input Format The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of pairs of points) and  (the circumference of the circle).  Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the values of  and  (i.e., the locations of the points in pair ). Constraints    Output Format Print a single integer denoting the maximum , , where . Sample Input 0 Sample Output 0 Explanation 0 In the diagram below, the relationship between points in pairs at non-overlapping indices is shown by a connecting line:  As you can see, the maximum distance between any two pairs of points is , so we print  as our answer. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 Explanation 1 In the diagram below, we have four individual points located at three indices:  Because two of the points overlap, the minimum distance between the two pairs of points is . Thus, we print  as our answer.

In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j]. If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing, return -1.   Example 1: Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4] Output: 1 Explanation: Replace 5 with 2, then arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].  Example 2: Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1] Output: 2 Explanation: Replace 5 with 3 and then replace 3 with 4. arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].  Example 3: Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,6,3,3] Output: -1 Explanation: You can't make arr1 strictly increasing.   Constraints:  1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 2000 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9
__label__Data-Structures This question is designed to help you get a better understanding of basic heap operations.  You will be given queries of  types: " "  - Add an element  to the heap.

__label__Array __label__Dynamic-Programming A sequence X_1, X_2, ..., X_n is fibonacci-like if:  n >= 3 X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2} for all i + 2 <= n  Given a strictly increasing array A of positive integers forming a sequence, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of A.  If one does not exist, return 0. (Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements (including none) from A, without changing the order of the remaining elements.  For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].)     Example 1: Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] Output: 5 Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].  Example 2: Input: [1,3,7,11,12,14,18] Output: 3 Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].    Note:  3 <= A.length <= 1000 1 <= A[0] < A[1] < ... < A[A.length - 1] <= 10^9 (The time limit has been reduced by 50% for submissions in Java, C, and C++.)
__label__Dynamic-Programming There are  bulbs in a straight line, numbered from  to .  Each bulb  has a button associated with it, and there is a cost, , for pressing this button. When some button  is pressed, all the bulbs at a distance  from bulb  will be toggled(off->on, on->off).  Given , , and the costs for each button, find and print the minimum cost of turning off all  bulbs if they're all on initially. Input Format The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  and .  The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective costs of each bulb (i.e., ). Constraints    Output Format Print a long integer denoting the minimum cost of turning off all  bulbs. Sample Input 3 1 1 1 1  Sample Output 1  Explanation If we press the middle switch, the middle bulb and the  closest adjacent bulbs (i.e., the first and third) will turn off. Because all bulbs will be off in one button press, this cost is minimal. Thus, we print  as our answer.
__label__Array On an infinite number line, the position of the i-th stone is given by stones[i].  Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position. Each turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone. In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone. The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions. When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made?  Return the answer as an length 2 array: answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]   Example 1: Input: [7,4,9] Output: [1,2] Explanation:  We can move 4 -> 8 for one move to finish the game. Or, we can move 9 -> 5, 4 -> 6 for two moves to finish the game.   Example 2: Input: [6,5,4,3,10] Output: [2,3] We can move 3 -> 8 then 10 -> 7 to finish the game. Or, we can move 3 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 5 -> 9 to finish the game. Notice we cannot move 10 -> 2 to finish the game, because that would be an illegal move.   Example 3: Input: [100,101,104,102,103] Output: [0,0]     Note:  3 <= stones.length <= 10^4 1 <= stones[i] <= 10^9 stones[i] have distinct values.

A correct answer has an absolute error of at most .   W B Input Format The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of balls) and  (the number of operations).  The second line describes the initial sequence balls as a single string of  characters; each character is either B or W and describes a black or white ball, respectively. B W Constraints  Output Format Print a single floating-point number denoting the expected number of white balls picked. Your answer is considered to be correct if it has an absolute error of at most .   Sample Input 0 Sample Output 0 Explanation 0  Independent of your choice of , one white ball will always be picked so the expected number of white balls chosen after  operation is . Thus, we print  as our answer. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 Explanation 1 We perform the following  operations:   Independent of your choice of , a white ball will always be chosen during the first operation (meaning the expected number of white balls in the first operation is ).   For the second operation, there are  possible row orderings (depending on which ball was picked during the first operation). In the first possible row ordering, the probability of picking a white ball is . In the second possible row ordering, the probability of picking a white ball is . This means the expected number of white balls chosen in the second operation is . After performing all  operations, we print the total expected number of white balls chosen, which is .

He can build any number of bidirectional roads as long as the resultant network satisfies these constraints: It must be possible to reach any city from any other city by traveling along the network of roads.   No two roads can directly connect the same two cities.    A road cannot directly connect a city to itself.   In other words, the roads and cities must form a simple connected labeled graph.

__label__Array __label__Dynamic-Programming Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.  Example 2: Input: [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0 Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
__label__Array __label__Hash-Table You are given an array of strings words and a string chars. A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once). Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.   Example 1: Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach" Output: 6 Explanation:  The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.  Example 2: Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr" Output: 10 Explanation:  The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.    Note:  1 <= words.length <= 1000 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100 All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

__label__Array Given an array arr that is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1], we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array. What is the most number of chunks we could have made? Example 1: Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0] Output: 1 Explanation: Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result. For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.  Example 2: Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4] Output: 4 Explanation: We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4]. However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.  Note:  arr will have length in range [1, 10]. arr[i] will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1].

Each HDD is located at an integer coordinate on an infinite straight line, and each pair consists of one primary HDD and one backup HDD. Next, you want to place  computers at integer coordinates on the same infinite straight line. Each pair of HDDs must then be connected to a single computer via wires, but a computer can have any number (even zero) of HDDs connected to it. The length of a wire connecting a single HDD to a computer is the absolute value of the distance between their respective coordinates on the infinite line. We consider the total length of wire used to connect all the HDDs to computers to be the sum of the lengths of all the wires used to connect HDDs to computers.

We then connect the second () and the third () pairs of HDDs to the first computer (at position ) and then connect the remaining pairs to the second computer (at position ).     We calculate the wire lengths needed to connect the drives to each computer. The amount of wire needed to connect the second and third drives to the first computer is , and the amount of wire needed to connect the rest of the drives to the second computer is . When we sum the lengths of wire needed to connect all pairs of drives to the two computers, we get a total length of . Thus, we print  as our answer.
__label__Array __label__Two-Pointers Your are given an array of positive integers nums. Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than k. Example 1: Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100 Output: 8 Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]. Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.   Note: 0 < nums.length <= 50000. 0 < nums[i] < 1000. 0 <= k < 10^6.
__label__Two-Pointers __label__Greedy-Algorithms A string S of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.  Example 1: Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij" Output: [9,7,8] Explanation: The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij". This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part. A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.   Note: S will have length in range [1, 500]. S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.
__label__Dynamic-Programming Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal. Example 1: Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat" Output: 231 Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum. Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum. At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.   Example 2: Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet" Output: 403 Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let", adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum. At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403. If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.   Note: 0 < s1.length, s2.length <= 1000. All elements of each string will have an ASCII value in [97, 122].
__label__Tree Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:  The root is the maximum number in the array.  The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number. The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.    Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.  Example 1: Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5] Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:        6     /   \    3     5     \    /       2  0           \         1   Note:  The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].
__label__Depth-first-Search We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string. We are allowed to place any color block C on top of two adjacent blocks of colors A and B, if and only if ABC is an allowed triple. We start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3. Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false. Example 1: Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"] Output: true Explanation: We can stack the pyramid like this:     A    / \   G   E  / \ / \ B   C   D  We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.   Example 2: Input: bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAC"] Output: false Explanation: We can't stack the pyramid to the top. Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.    Note:  bottom will be a string with length in range [2, 8]. allowed will have length in range [0, 200]. Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}.
__label__Dynamic-Programming We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1]. We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width shelf_width. We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is <= shelf_width), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place. Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf. Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.   Example 1:  Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4 Output: 6 Explanation: The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.    Constraints:  1 <= books.length <= 1000 1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000 1 <= books[i][1] <= 1000
__label__Strings Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as "hello" -> "heeellooo", "hi" -> "hiiii".  In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:  "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo". For some given string S, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to S by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more. For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo".  If S = "helllllooo", then the query word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = S. Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy.    Example: Input:  S = "heeellooo" words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"] Output: 1 Explanation:  We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo". We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.    Notes:   0 <= len(S) <= 100. 0 <= len(words) <= 100. 0 <= len(words[i]) <= 100. S and all words in words consist only of lowercase letters
__label__Hash-Table __label__Strings Given an expression such as expression = "e + 8 - a + 5" and an evaluation map such as {"e": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = ["e"] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as ["-1*a","14"]  An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol. A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer. A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like "2x" or "-x".  Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, expression = "1 + 2 * 3" has an answer of ["7"]. The format of the output is as follows:  For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like "b*a*c", only "a*b*c". Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, "a*a*b*c" has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term. The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed. An example of a well formatted answer is ["-2*a*a*a", "3*a*a*b", "3*b*b", "4*a", "5*c", "-6"]  Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example, an expression of "0" has an output of [].  Examples: Input: expression = "e + 8 - a + 5", evalvars = ["e"], evalints = [1] Output: ["-1*a","14"]  Input: expression = "e - 8 + temperature - pressure", evalvars = ["e", "temperature"], evalints = [1, 12] Output: ["-1*pressure","5"]  Input: expression = "(e + 8) * (e - 8)", evalvars = [], evalints = [] Output: ["1*e*e","-64"]  Input: expression = "7 - 7", evalvars = [], evalints = [] Output: []  Input: expression = "a * b * c + b * a * c * 4", evalvars = [], evalints = [] Output: ["5*a*b*c"]  Input: expression = "((a - b) * (b - c) + (c - a)) * ((a - b) + (b - c) * (c - a))", evalvars = [], evalints = [] Output: ["-1*a*a*b*b","2*a*a*b*c","-1*a*a*c*c","1*a*b*b*b","-1*a*b*b*c","-1*a*b*c*c","1*a*c*c*c","-1*b*b*b*c","2*b*b*c*c","-1*b*c*c*c","2*a*a*b","-2*a*a*c","-2*a*b*b","2*a*c*c","1*b*b*b","-1*b*b*c","1*b*c*c","-1*c*c*c","-1*a*a","1*a*b","1*a*c","-1*b*c"]  Note:  expression will have length in range [1, 250]. evalvars, evalints will have equal lengths in range [0, 100].
__label__Mathematics Given an array of integers A and let n to be its length.   Assume Bk to be an array obtained by rotating the array A k positions clock-wise, we define a "rotation function" F on A as follow:   F(k) = 0 * Bk[0] + 1 * Bk[1] + ... + (n-1) * Bk[n-1]. Calculate the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).   Note: n is guaranteed to be less than 105.  Example: A = [4, 3, 2, 6]  F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25 F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16 F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23 F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26  So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.
__label__Hash-Table Given a list of strings words representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.  If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.  If there is no answer, return the empty string.  Example 1: Input:  words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"] Output: "world" Explanation:  The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".   Example 2: Input:  words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"] Output: "apple" Explanation:  Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".   Note: All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters. The length of words will be in the range [1, 1000]. The length of words[i] will be in the range [1, 30].
__label__Strings __label__Dynamic-Programming Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively. Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":     great    /    \   gr    eat  / \    /  \ g   r  e   at            / \           a   t  To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children. For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".     rgeat    /    \   rg    eat  / \    /  \ r   g  e   at            / \           a   t  We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great". Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".     rgtae    /    \   rg    tae  / \    /  \ r   g  ta  e        / \       t   a  We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great". Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1. Example 1: Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat" Output: true  Example 2: Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd" Output: false
__label__Dynamic-Programming You have an infinite number of 4 types of lego blocks of sizes given as (depth x height x width): Using these blocks, you want to make a wall of height  and width . Features of the wall are:   - The wall should not have any holes in it.  - The wall you build should be one solid structure, so there should not be a straight vertical break across all rows of bricks.  - The bricks must be laid horizontally.    How many ways can the wall be built? For example, the wall's height  and its width .  Here are some configurations:     These are not all of the valid permutations.

Example: Input:     1     \      3     /    2  Output: 1  Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).    Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
__label__Strings James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.    To do this, he follows two rules:   He can only reduce the value of a letter by , i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.   The letter a may not be reduced any further.   Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome. For example, given the string , the following two operations are performed:  cde → cdd → cdc.   Function Description  Complete the theLoveLetterMystery function in the editor below.  It should return the integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome.   theLoveLetterMystery has the following parameter(s):   s: a string Input Format The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.  The next  lines will each contain a string . Constraints    | s |   All strings are composed of lower case English letters, *ascii[a-z], with no spaces.

Sample Input 4 abc abcba abcd cba  Sample Output 2 0 4 2  Explanation For the first test case, abc → abb → aba. For the second test case, abcba is already a palindromic string. For the third test case, abcd → abcc → abcb → abca → abba. For the fourth test case, cba → bba → aba.
__label__Array We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).   Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero. Example 1: Input:  bits = [1, 0, 0] Output: True Explanation:  The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.   Example 2: Input:  bits = [1, 1, 1, 0] Output: False Explanation:  The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.   Note: 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000. bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

__label__Mathematics __label__Strings A string S of lowercase letters is given.  Then, we may make any number of moves. In each move, we choose one of the first K letters (starting from the left), remove it, and place it at the end of the string. Return the lexicographically smallest string we could have after any number of moves.    Example 1: Input: S = "cba", K = 1 Output: "acb" Explanation:  In the first move, we move the 1st character ("c") to the end, obtaining the string "bac". In the second move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the final result "acb".   Example 2: Input: S = "baaca", K = 3 Output: "aaabc" Explanation:  In the first move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the string "aacab". In the second move, we move the 3rd character ("c") to the end, obtaining the final result "aaabc".    Note:  1 <= K <= S.length <= 1000 S consists of lowercase letters only.

__label__Mathematics __label__Binary-Search You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins. Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed. n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. Example 1: n = 5  The coins can form the following rows: ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤  Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.   Example 2: n = 8  The coins can form the following rows: ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤  Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
__label__Array Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image. To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1]. To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0]. Example 1: Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]] Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]] Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]. Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]  Example 2: Input: [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]] Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]] Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]. Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]  Notes:  1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 20 0 <= A[i][j] <= 1

__label__Strings A gene is represented as a string of length  (where  is divisible by ), composed of the letters , , , and . It is considered to be steady if each of the four letters occurs exactly  times.  For example,  and  are both steady genes. Bear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady.  Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string .  It is not necessarily steady.  Fortunately, Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of  and replace it with any string of the same length. Modifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous. Given a string , can you help Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make  a steady gene? Note: A substring of a string  is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of . As an example, consider .  The substring  just before or after  can be replaced with  or .  One selection would create . Function Description Complete the  function in the editor below.

__label__Dynamic-Programming A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water. Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.  If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction. Note:  The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100. Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231. The first stone's position is always 0.   Example 1: [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]  There are a total of 8 stones. The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit, third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on... The last stone at the 17th unit.  Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping  1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then  2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,  4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.   Example 2: [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]  Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as  the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
__label__Dynamic-Programming One day, Wet Shark was given an array . As always, he started playing with its subsequences.   When you came to know about this habit, you presented him a task of finding all pairs of subsequences, , which satisfies all of the following constraints. We will represent a pair of subsequence as  and    and  must be of same length, i.e., .   Please help Wet Shark determine how many possible subsequences  and  can exist.

__label__Dynamic-Programming A new gangster is trying to take control of the city. He makes a list of his  adversaries (e.g. gangster , gangster , ... gangster , gangster ) and plans to get rid of them.  mercenaries are willing to do the job. The gangster can use any number of these mercenaries. But he has to honor one condition set by them: they have to be assigned in such a way that they eliminate a consecutive group of gangsters in the list, e.g. gangster , gangster , ..., gangster , gangster , where the following is true: . While our new gangster wants to kill all of them, he also wants to pay the least amount of money. All mercenaries charge a different amount to kill different people. So he asks you to help him minimize his expenses.   Input Format The first line contains two space-separated integers,   and .

__label__Strings The Kingdom of Gridland contains  provinces. Each province is defined as a  grid where each cell in the grid represents a city. Every cell in the grid contains a single lowercase character denoting the first character of the city name corresponding to that cell. From a city with the coordinates , it is possible to move to any of the following cells in  unit of time (provided that the destination cell is within the confines of the grid):     A knight wants to visit all the cities in Gridland. He can start his journey in any city and immediately stops his journey after having visited each city at least once. Moreover, he always plans his journey in such a way that the total time required to complete it is minimum. After completing his tour of each province, the knight forms a string by concatenating the characters of all the cells in his path. How many distinct strings can he form in each province? Input Format The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of provinces. The  subsequent lines describe each province over the following three lines:  The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of columns in the province.  Each of the next two lines contains a string, , of length  denoting the characters for the first and second row of the province. Constraints       Output Format For each province, print the number of distinct strings the knight can form on a new line. Sample Input 3 1 a a 3 dab abd 5 ababa babab  Sample Output 1 8 2  Explanation Province 0:   The knight can only form one string (aa), so we print  on a new line. aa Province 1:   The knight can form eight different strings (abdbad, adabdb, badabd, bdbada, dababd, dabdba, dbabad, and dbadab), so we print  on a new line.  abdbad adabdb badabd bdbada dababd dabdba dbabad dbadab Province 2:   The knight can form two different strings (ababababab and bababababa), so we print  on a new line. ababababab bababababa
__label__Array __label__Dynamic-Programming __label__Greedy-Algorithms Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.  You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.) Return the maximum profit you can make. Example 1: Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by: Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] = 4Selling at prices[5] = 9The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

__label__Mathematics On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid cell (i, j). Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes. A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane.  Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side. Return the total area of all three projections.                                          Example 1: Input: [[2]] Output: 5   Example 2: Input: [[1,2],[3,4]] Output: 17 Explanation:  Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.

We may assume that no string in A is substring of another string in A.    Example 1: Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"] Output: "alexlovesleetcode" Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.   Example 2: Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"] Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"     Note:  1 <= A.length <= 12 1 <= A[i].length <= 20
__label__Hash-Table Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position. Find the letter that was added in t. Example: Input: s = "abcd" t = "abcde"  Output: e  Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
__label__Mathematics Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation. The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary. For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.      Example 1: Input: 5 Output: 2 Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.   Example 2: Input: 7 Output: 0 Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.   Example 3: Input: 10 Output: 5 Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.    Note:  0 <= N < 10^9

Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:  If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed; If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.  At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)   Example 1: Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1] Output: 1 Explanation:  We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then, we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then, we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then, we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.    Note:  1 <= stones.length <= 30 1 <= stones[i] <= 100

__label__Search There are  bikers present in a city (shaped as a grid) having  bikes. All the bikers want to participate in the HackerRace competition, but unfortunately only  bikers can be accommodated in the race. Jack is organizing the HackerRace and wants to start the race as soon as possible. He can instruct any biker to move towards any bike in the city. In order to minimize the time to start the race, Jack instructs the bikers in such a way that the first  bikes are acquired in the minimum time. Every biker moves with a unit speed and one bike can be acquired by only one biker. A biker can proceed in any direction. Consider distance between bikes and bikers as Euclidean distance. Jack would like to know the square of required time to start the race as soon as possible.  Input Format The first line contains three integers, , , and , separated by a single space.  The following  lines will contain  pairs of integers denoting the co-ordinates of  bikers. Each pair of integers is separated by a single space. The next  lines will similarly denote the co-ordinates of the  bikes. Constraints       ,   Output Format A single line containing the square of required time. Sample Input 3 3 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 100 1 200 2  300 3  Sample Output 40000  Explanation There's need for two bikers for the race. The first biker (0,1) will be able to reach the first bike (100,1) in 100 time units. The second biker (0,2) will be able to reach the second bike (200,2) in 200 time units. This is the most optimal solution and will take 200 time units. So output will be 2002 = 40000.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)   Example 1: Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1] Output: 1 Explanation:  We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then, we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then, we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then, we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.   Note:  1 <= stones.length <= 30 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
__label__Mathematics Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...  Note: n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).  Example 1: Input: 3  Output: 3   Example 2: Input: 11  Output: 0  Explanation: The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
__label__Hash-Table Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries. To be specific, your design should include these functions:  put(key, value) : Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the value already exists in the HashMap, update the value. get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key. remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key if this map contains the mapping for the key.   Example: MyHashMap hashMap = new MyHashMap(); hashMap.put(1, 1);           hashMap.put(2, 2);          hashMap.get(1);            // returns 1 hashMap.get(3);            // returns -1 (not found) hashMap.put(2, 1);          // update the existing value hashMap.get(2);            // returns 1  hashMap.remove(2);          // remove the mapping for 2 hashMap.get(2);            // returns -1 (not found)    Note:  All keys and values will be in the range of [0, 1000000]. The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 10000]. Please do not use the built-in HashMap library.
__label__Greedy-Algorithms You are given two  arrays,  and , both containing  integers. A pair of indices  is beautiful if the  element of array  is equal to the  element of array . In other words, pair  is beautiful if and only if . A set containing beautiful pairs is called a beautiful set. A beautiful set is called pairwise disjoint if for every pair  belonging to the set there is no repetition of either  or  values. For instance, if  and  the beautiful set  is not pairwise disjoint as there is a repetition of , that is .  Your task is to change exactly  element in  so that the size of the pairwise disjoint beautiful set is maximum. Function Description  Complete the beautifulPairs function in the editor below.  It should return an integer that represents the maximum number of pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs that can be formed.   beautifulPairs has the following parameters:   A: an array of integers   B: an array of integers   Input Format The first line contains a single integer , the number of elements in  and .  The second line contains  space-separated integers .  The third line contains  space-separated integers . Constraints   Output Format Determine and print the maximum possible number of pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs.  Note: You must first change  element in , and your choice of element must be optimal. Sample Input 0 Sample Output 0 Explanation 0 You are given  and .  The beautiful set is  and maximum sized pairwise disjoint beautiful set is either  or .  We can do better. We change the  element of array  from  to . Now new B array is:  and the pairwise disjoint beautiful set is . So, the answer is 4.  Note that we could have also selected index 3 instead of index 2 but it would have yeilded the same result. Any other choice of index is not optimal. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1
__label__Tree Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null. The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation. Example 1: Input:              1          /   \         3     2        / \     \         5   3     9   Output: 4 Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).  Example 2: Input:             1          /           3            / \              5   3       Output: 2 Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).  Example 3: Input:             1          / \         3   2         /               5        Output: 2 Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).  Example 4: Input:             1          / \         3   2        /     \         5       9       /         \     6           7 Output: 8 Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).    Note: Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
__label__Depth-first-Search Given the root of a binary tree, consider all root to leaf paths: paths from the root to any leaf.  (A leaf is a node with no children.) A node is insufficient if every such root to leaf path intersecting this node has sum strictly less than limit. Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.   Example 1:  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,-99,-99,7,8,9,-99,-99,12,13,-99,14], limit = 1  Output: [1,2,3,4,null,null,7,8,9,null,14]   Example 2:  Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,1,null,null,5,3], limit = 22  Output: [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,null,null,null,5]   Example 3:  Input: root = [1,2,-3,-5,null,4,null], limit = -1  Output: [1,null,-3,4]    Note:  The given tree will have between 1 and 5000 nodes. -10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5 -10^9 <= limit <= 10^9
__label__Graph-Algorithms __label__Graph-Algorithms Dave is a die-hard fan of a show called "HackerRank", in which a young programmer uses her problem-solving abilities to solve crimes. He splurged on a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) so that he can record HackerRank episodes and watch them later. Luckily, Dave managed to get his hands on schedules for all the episodes in each upcoming season. Each season has  episodes numbered from  to . Each episode airs twice; the first time it's called "live", and the second time it's called "repeat". So, for each episode, we have  integers,  and  for the live airing and  and  for the repeat airing, where  is episode's start time and and  is its end time. All times are given as integers representing the number of minutes passed since the start of the season. Episodes broadcast on multiple channels, so some of the air times overlap and the episodes may not broadcast sequentially. It's possible that both the live and repeat broadcasts of some episode  are held before episode , even though . In addition, live and repeat broadcasts of the same episode may differ in length due to the number of advertisements during the broadcast.  Dave only has one TV with a DVR attached to it, and the DVR is capable of recording one episode at a time. For each episode in a season, Dave first decides whether or not he will record it. If he decides to record it, he will either record it during  or . Dave will only ever record one of the two airings of an episode, and he always records full episodes. This means that once he starts recording an episode, he will always record it until the end (i.e., he never records partial episodes).  Dave realizes that it might not be possible for him to record all episodes successfully, so instead of focusing on recording all episodes of HackerRank (which may be impossible), he decides to record all consecutively airing episodes whose episode number occurs in some inclusive  interval such that  (i.e., the number of consecutive episodes recorded) is as large as possible.    Given the programming schedule for each season, find  and  episode numbers for largest range of consecutive episodes Dave can record during that season and print these respective values as two space-separated integers on a new line. If two or more such intervals exist, choose the one having the smallest  value. Input Format The first line contains a single positive integer, , denoting number of seasons of HackerRank.  The subsequent lines describe each of the  seasons in the following format: The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of episodes in the season. Each line  of the  subsequent line contains four space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , , and . Constraints       Output Format On a new line for each season, print two space-separated integers denoting the respective  and  (inclusive) values for the maximum possible range of consecutive episodes Dave can record such that  is as large as possible. If more than one such interval exists, choose the interval having the smallest . Sample Input 3 3 10 20 30 40 20 35 21 35 14 30 35 50 1 10 20 30 40 3 11 19 31 39 12 38 13 37 10 20 30 40  Sample Output 1 2 1 1 1 1  Explanation For the first season, Dave records the live airing of episode  and the repeat airing of episode . Note that it is not possible to record episodes ,  and  simultaneously. For the second season, there is only one episode so Dave records from episode  to episode  and we print 1 1 on a new line. 1 1 For the third season, Dave must choose to record either episode  or episode  (episode  starts while episode  is still airing and ends after episode  starts); he cannot record both, because he only wants to record consecutive episodes. Thus, we pick the episode with the smallest  value, which is episode , and print 1 1 as we are only recording episode . 1 1
__label__Two-Pointers In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i]. You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:  Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop. Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.  Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop. You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each. What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?   Example 1: Input: [1,2,1] Output: 3 Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].   Example 2: Input: [0,1,2,2] Output: 3 Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2]. If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].   Example 3: Input: [1,2,3,2,2] Output: 4 Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2]. If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].   Example 4: Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4] Output: 5 Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2]. If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.       Note:  1 <= tree.length <= 40000 0 <= tree[i] < tree.length
__label__Array Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set). Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Example: Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [   [3],   [1],   [2],   [1,2,3],   [1,3],   [2,3],   [1,2],   [] ]
__label__Array Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums. Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes i+1 < j with (A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i] == A[i+1] + A[i+2] + ... + A[j-1] == A[j] + A[j-1] + ... + A[A.length - 1])   Example 1: Input: [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1] Output: true Explanation: 0 + 2 + 1 = -6 + 6 - 7 + 9 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1   Example 2: Input: [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1] Output: false   Example 3: Input: [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4] Output: true Explanation: 3 + 3 = 6 = 5 - 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 - 9 + 4      Note:  3 <= A.length <= 50000 -10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
__label__Depth-first-Search Given a 2-dimensional grid of integers, each value in the grid represents the color of the grid square at that location. Two squares belong to the same connected component if and only if they have the same color and are next to each other in any of the 4 directions. The border of a connected component is all the squares in the connected component that are either 4-directionally adjacent to a square not in the component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column). Given a square at location (r0, c0) in the grid and a color, color the border of the connected component of that square with the given color, and return the final grid.   Example 1: Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 0, color = 3 Output: [[3, 3], [3, 2]]   Example 2: Input: grid = [[1,2,2],[2,3,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 1, color = 3 Output: [[1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 3]]   Example 3: Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], r0 = 1, c0 = 1, color = 2 Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]     Note:  1 <= grid.length <= 50 1 <= grid[0].length <= 50 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000 0 <= r0 < grid.length 0 <= c0 < grid[0].length 1 <= color <= 1000
__label__Dynamic-Programming You are given a tree that has N vertices and N-1 edges. Your task is to mark as small number of vertices as possible, such that, the maximum distance between two unmarked vertices is less than or equal to K. Output this value. Distance between two vertices i and j is defined as the minimum number of edges you have to pass in order to reach vertex i from vertex j.   Input Format  The first line of input contains two integers N and K. The next N-1 lines contain two integers (ui,vi) each, where 1 <= ui,vi <= N. Each of these lines specifies an edge.  N is no more than 100. K is less than N.   Output Format  Print an integer that denotes the result of the test.

__label__Array __label__Hash-Table Given an array of integers A with even length, return true if and only if it is possible to reorder it such that A[2 * i + 1] = 2 * A[2 * i] for every 0 <= i < len(A) / 2.            Example 1: Input: [3,1,3,6] Output: false   Example 2: Input: [2,1,2,6] Output: false   Example 3: Input: [4,-2,2,-4] Output: true Explanation: We can take two groups, [-2,-4] and [2,4] to form [-2,-4,2,4] or [2,4,-2,-4].   Example 4: Input: [1,2,4,16,8,4] Output: false    Note:  0 <= A.length <= 30000 A.length is even -100000 <= A[i] <= 100000
__label__Strings You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:    'A' : Absent.  'L' : Late.  'P' : Present.     A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).     You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record. Example 1: Input: "PPALLP" Output: True   Example 2: Input: "PPALLL" Output: False
__label__Hash-Table There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant. Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:  If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied. Otherwise, it becomes vacant.  (Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.) We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0. Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)        Example 1: Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7 Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] Explanation:  The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day: Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1] Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]    Example 2: Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000 Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]    Note:  cells.length == 8 cells[i] is in {0, 1} 1 <= N <= 10^9
__label__Dynamic-Programming You are given a grid having N rows and M columns. A grid square can either be blocked or empty. Blocked squares are represented by a '#' and empty squares are represented by '.'. Find the number of ways to tile the grid using L shaped bricks. A L brick has one side of length three units while other of length 2 units. All empty squares in the grid should be covered by exactly one of the L shaped tiles, and blocked squares should not be covered by any tile. The bricks can be used in any orientation (they can be rotated or flipped). Input Format The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each test case contains N and M on the first line, followed by N lines describing each row of the grid. Constraints 1 <= T <= 50  1 <= N <= 20  1 <= M <= 8  Each grid square will be either '.' or '#'. Output Format Output the number of ways to tile the grid. Output each answer modulo 1000000007. Sample Input 3   2 4   ....   ....   3 3   ...   .#.   ...   2 2   ##   ##  Sample Output 2   4   1  Explanation NOTE:  If all points in the grid are blocked the number of ways is 1, as in the last sample testcase.
__label__Mathematics __label__Tree __label__Data-Structures __label__Advanced-Data-Structures A subsequence of a sequence is a sequence which is obtained by deleting zero or more elements from the sequence.  You are given a sequence A in which every element is a pair of integers  i.e  A = [(a1, w1), (a2, w2),..., (aN, wN)]. A A For a subseqence B = [(b1, v1), (b2, v2), ...., (bM, vM)] of the given sequence :  B We call it increasing if for every i (1 <= i < M ) , bi < bi+1. Weight(B) = v1 + v2 + ... + vM.   Task:  Given a sequence, output the maximum weight formed by an increasing subsequence. Input:  The first line of input contains a single integer T. T test-cases follow. The first line of each test-case contains an integer N. The next line contains a1, a2 ,... , aN separated by a single space. The next line contains w1, w2, ..., wN separated by a single space. Output:  For each test-case output a single integer: The maximum weight of increasing subsequences of the given sequence.   Constraints:  1 <= T <= 5  1 <= N <= 150000  1 <= ai <= 109, where i ∈ [1..N]  1 <= wi <= 109, where i ∈ [1..N]  Sample Input: 2   4   1 2 3 4   10 20 30 40   8   1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4   10 20 30 40 15 15 15 50  Sample Output: 100   110  Explanation:  In the first sequence, the maximum size increasing subsequence is 4, and there's only one of them. We choose B = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 40)], and we have Weight(B) = 100. B = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 40)] Weight(B) = 100 In the second sequence, the maximum size increasing subsequence is still 4, but there are now 5 possible subsequences: 1 2 3 4   10 20 30 40  1 2 3 4   10 20 30 50  1 2 3 4   10 20 15 50  1 2 3 4   10 15 15 50  1 2 3 4   15 15 15 50  Of those, the one with the greatest weight is B = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 50)], with Weight(B) = 110. B = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 50)] Weight(B) = 110 Please note that this is not the maximum weight generated from picking the highest value element of each index. That value, 115, comes from [(1, 15), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 50)], which is not a valid subsequence because it cannot be created by only deleting elements in the original sequence.

__label__Tree Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.  Example 1:  Given tree s:      3     / \    4   5   / \  1   2  Given tree t:    4    / \  1   2  Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.

__label__Data-Structures This challenge is part of a tutorial track by MyCodeSchool You’re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists. The data in both lists will be sorted in ascending order. Change the next pointers to obtain a single, merged linked list which also has data in ascending order. Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty. next Input Format You have to complete the SinglyLinkedListNode MergeLists(SinglyLinkedListNode headA, SinglyLinkedListNode headB) method which takes two arguments - the heads of the two sorted linked lists to merge. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. SinglyLinkedListNode MergeLists(SinglyLinkedListNode headA, SinglyLinkedListNode headB) The input is handled by the code in the editor and the format is as follows:   The first line contains an integer , denoting the number of test cases.  The format for each test case is as follows:   The first line contains an integer , denoting the length of the first linked list.  The next  lines contain an integer each, denoting the elements of the linked list.  The next line contains an integer , denoting the length of the second linked list.  The next  lines contain an integer each, denoting the elements of the second linked list.   Constraints    , where  is the  element of the list. Output Format Change the next pointer of individual nodes so that nodes from both lists are merged into a single list. Then return the head of this merged list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console. next return The output is handled by the editor and the format is as follows:   For each test case, print in a new line, the linked list after merging them separated by spaces.

__label__Strings We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an email address or a phone number. We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:  1. Email address: We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z. An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name.  All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of "name1@name2.name3". To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.  2. Phone number: A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits. The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits. The local number should be formatted and masked as "***-***-1111", where 1 represents the exposed digits. To mask a phone number with country code like "+111 111 111 1111", we write it in the form "+***-***-***-1111".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with "+**-". Note that extraneous characters like "(", ")", " ", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.   Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.   Example 1: Input: "LeetCode@LeetCode.com" Output: "l*****e@leetcode.com" Explanation: All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between the              first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 asterisks.              Therefore, "leetcode" -> "l*****e".  Example 2: Input: "AB@qq.com" Output: "a*****b@qq.com" Explanation: There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter               of the first name "ab". Therefore, "ab" -> "a*****b".  Example 3: Input: "1(234)567-890" Output: "***-***-7890" Explanation: 10 digits in the phone number, which means all digits make up the local number.  Example 4: Input: "86-(10)12345678" Output: "+**-***-***-5678" Explanation: 12 digits, 2 digits for country code and 10 digits for local number.   Notes:  S.length <= 40. Emails have length at least 8. Phone numbers have length at least 10.
__label__Tree You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value. Find the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes). The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.  Example: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8        10      /  \     5   -3    / \    \   3   2   11  / \   \ 3  -2   1  Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:  1.  5 -> 3 2.  5 -> 2 -> 1 3. -3 -> 11
__label__Binary-Search Given the root of a binary search tree with distinct values, modify it so that every node has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val. As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.    Example 1:  Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8] Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]      Note:  The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100. Each node will have value between 0 and 100. The given tree is a binary search tree.

You are given Q queries, each of which is either an update or a retrieval operation.  Initially all node values are zero.   The update query is of the format a1 d1 a2 d2 A B  This means you'd have to add  in all nodes in the path from A to B where  is the distance between the node and A. The retrieval query is of the format i j  You need to return the sum of the node values lying in the path from node i to node j modulo 1000000007.  Note:    First all update queries are given and then all retrieval queries.   Distance between 2 nodes is the shortest path length between them taking each edge weight as 1.   Input Format  The first line contains two integers (N and R respectively) separated by a space.   In the next N-1 lines, the ith line describes the ith edge: a line with two integers x y separated by a single space denotes an edge between nodes x and y.   The next line contains 2 space separated integers (U and Q respectively) representing the number of Update and Query operations to follow.   U lines follow. Each of the next U lines contains 6 space separated integers (a1,d1,a2,d2,A and B respectively). Each of the next Q lines contains 2 space separated integers, i and j respectively.

__label__Tree __label__Depth-first-Search You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition: struct Node {   int val;   Node *left;   Node *right;   Node *next; }  Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.   Example:  Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}  Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}  Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.    Note:  You may only use constant extra space. Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

__label__Mathematics Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations. Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.  You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations. Example 1: Input:  m = 3, n = 3 operations = [[2,2],[3,3]] Output: 4 Explanation:  Initially, M =  [[0, 0, 0],  [0, 0, 0],  [0, 0, 0]]  After performing [2,2], M =  [[1, 1, 0],  [1, 1, 0],  [0, 0, 0]]  After performing [3,3], M =  [[2, 2, 1],  [2, 2, 1],  [1, 1, 1]]  So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.   Note:  The range of m and n is [1,40000]. The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n]. The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

For example, the diagram below depicts the possible locations that  or  can move to from its current location at the center of a  chessboard:  Observe that for each possible movement, the Knight moves  units in one direction (i.e., horizontal or vertical) and  unit in the perpendicular direction. Given the value of  for an  chessboard, answer the following question for each  pair where : What is the minimum number of moves it takes for  to get from position  to position ?

__label__Strings __label__Dynamic-Programming Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T. A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not). Example 1: Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit" Output: 3 Explanation:  As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S. (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)  rabbbit ^^^^ ^^ rabbbit ^^ ^^^^ rabbbit ^^^ ^^^  Example 2: Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag" Output: 5 Explanation:  As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S. (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)  babgbag ^^ ^ babgbag ^^    ^ babgbag ^    ^^ babgbag   ^  ^^ babgbag     ^^^
__label__Strings You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.  The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.  An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.  (An integer could be positive or negative.)  A let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string "let", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.  An add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string "add", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.  A mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string "mult", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.  For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names "add", "let", or "mult" are protected and will never be used as variable names.  Finally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.  Evaluation Examples: Input: (add 1 2) Output: 3  Input: (mult 3 (add 2 3)) Output: 15  Input: (let x 2 (mult x 5)) Output: 10  Input: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y)))) Output: 14 Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x, we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate. Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.  Input: (let x 3 x 2 x) Output: 2 Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.  Input: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y)) Output: 5 Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x. The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.  Input: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x)) Output: 6 Explanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context of the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.  Input: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2)  Output 4 Explanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.   Note: The given string expression is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer. The length of expression is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.) The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

On refueling 2 gallon of fuel at city 2, he then travels back to city 0 by using 2 gallons of fuel.   Here is the second possible solution.  Steven starts from city 2, fill his car with 2 gallons, and travels to city 0.  On refueling 3 gallons of fuel from city 0, he then travels to city 1, and exhausts 2 gallons of fuel. His fuel tank contains 1 gallon of fuel now. He can then refuel 1 gallon of fuel at City 1, and increase his car's fuel to 2 gallons and travel to city 2.  However, Steven cannot start from city 1, because he is given only 1 gallon of fuel, but travelling to city 2 requires 2 gallons.  Hence the answer 2.
__label__Greedy-Algorithms Given a string S of '(' and ')' parentheses, we add the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', and in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid. Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:  It is the empty string, or It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.  Given a parentheses string, return the minimum number of parentheses we must add to make the resulting string valid.   Example 1: Input: "())" Output: 1   Example 2: Input: "(((" Output: 3   Example 3: Input: "()" Output: 0   Example 4: Input: "()))((" Output: 4      Note:  S.length <= 1000 S only consists of '(' and ')' characters.

__label__Graph-Algorithms Jack has just moved to a new city called Rapture. He wants to use the public public transport system. The fare rules are as follows:   Each pair of connected stations has a fare assigned to it regardless of direction of travel.   If a passenger travels from station A to station B, he only has to pay the  difference between the fare from A to B and the cumulative fare that he has paid to reach station A [fare(A,B) - total fare to reach station A].  If the difference is negative, he can travel free of cost from A to B.   Jack is low on cash and needs your help to figure out the most cost efficient way to go from the first station to the last station. Given the number of stations  (numbered from  to ), and the fare between the  pairs of stations that are connected, determine the lowest fare from station  to station .

__label__Tree Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure. Example:  You may serialize the following tree:      1    / \   2   3      / \     4   5  as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"  Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself. Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

__label__Dynamic-Programming An Introduction to the Longest Increasing Subsequence Problem  The task is to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given array of integers such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in strictly ascending order. This is called the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. For example, the length of the LIS for  is  since the longest increasing subsequence is .   Here's a great YouTube video of a lecture from MIT's Open-CourseWare covering the topic.     This is one approach which solves this in quadratic time using dynamic programming. A more efficient algorithm which solves the problem in  time is available here.  Given a sequence of integers, find the length of its longest strictly increasing subsequence. Function Description  Complete the longestIncreasingSubsequence function in the editor below.  It should return an integer that denotes the array's LIS.   longestIncreasingSubsequence has the following parameter(s):   arr: an unordered array of integers   Input Format The first line contains a single integer , the number of elements in .

__label__Array In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character. For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy". Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group. The final answer should be in lexicographic order.   Example 1: Input: "abbxxxxzzy" Output: [[3,6]] Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.  Example 2: Input: "abc" Output: [] Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.  Example 3: Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd" Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]   Note:  1 <= S.length <= 1000
__label__Strings Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign. For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name. Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s. If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.) If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.) It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time. Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails?     Example 1: Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"] Output: 2 Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails    Note:  1 <= emails[i].length <= 100 1 <= emails.length <= 100 Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character. All local and domain names are non-empty. Local names do not start with a '+' character.
__label__Binary-Search Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive. Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive. Note: A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that. Example: Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2, Output: 3  Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
__label__Binary-Search Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. (Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x, and by convention, 0! = 1.) For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given K, find how many non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = K. Example 1: Input: K = 0 Output: 5 Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.  Example 2: Input: K = 5 Output: 0 Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.  Note:  K will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
__label__Array __label__Two-Pointers You are given a circular array nums of positive and negative integers. If a number k at an index is positive, then move forward k steps. Conversely, if it's negative (-k), move backward k steps. Since the array is circular, you may assume that the last element's next element is the first element, and the first element's previous element is the last element. Determine if there is a loop (or a cycle) in nums. A cycle must start and end at the same index and the cycle's length > 1. Furthermore, movements in a cycle must all follow a single direction. In other words, a cycle must not consist of both forward and backward movements.   Example 1: Input: [2,-1,1,2,2] Output: true Explanation: There is a cycle, from index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0. The cycle's length is 3.  Example 2: Input: [-1,2] Output: false Explanation: The movement from index 1 -> 1 -> 1 ... is not a cycle, because the cycle's length is 1. By definition the cycle's length must be greater than 1.  Example 3: Input: [-2,1,-1,-2,-2] Output: false Explanation: The movement from index 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle, because movement from index 1 -> 2 is a forward movement, but movement from index 2 -> 1 is a backward movement. All movements in a cycle must follow a single direction.   Note:  -1000 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000 nums[i] ≠ 0 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5000    Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space complexity?

__label__Game-Theory General Iroh and Commandant Bumi are heading to the Republic City to stop a rebellion. But it's quite a long travel, so in the meantime they have started discussing about possible attacking plans. Right now, they're arguing about best ways for moving soldiers during the battle. Tired of not getting a final and concise strategy, Iroh proposed a particularly original idea. Iroh: Bumi, look at this map: here we have all possible locations in the battle field soldiers can occupy. I know a game which can give us some ideas.  Bumi: A game? How will a game help us here?  Iroh: It's pretty simple, we know which location is connected to each one, and also, that all those paths between locations are one-way (it's too dangerous to have two ways paths), so we place some soldiers at random initial locations, take turns, and in each turn, we try to make a valid move with one soldier from one location to another. Eventually, we won't be able to move any man so, the first one which is not able to perform any valid move, loses. One important thing is, at some moment, we may have some men at the same field location.  Bumi: Are you sure we are gonna end this? We have so many locations and paths... don't know, soldiers could be moving in circles for ever.  Iroh: Take it easy man, those paths were built by the best architects I've ever known, so there is no way that could happen.  Bumi: Well, I still don't get how does this help us.  Iroh: Me neither, but greatest generals from the Earth Kingdom created their strategies from this game, so, who knows?  Bumi: Ok, I'm in. Who plays first?  Iroh: You go first my friend. Just make sure you always do your best, because I will show no mercy to you :).  Input Format First line in the input contains two integers N and M, describing the number of locations and paths between them, respectively. M lines follow, each one with two integers u and v, denoting a one-way path from u to v.  Then comes a line with a single integer Q, denoting how many times Bumi and Iroh played the game over the given field. Q queries follow each one with two lines, first one with a single integer K, the number of soldiers in the field; and second one with K integers b_i separated by space, each one denoting the initial location of some soldier. Constraints 1 < N <= 105  1 <= M <= 106  1 <= u, v, b_i <= N  1 <= K <= 102  1 <= Q <= 105  Output Format Output Q lines, each one saying Bumi if Bumi should be the winner of the corresponding game or Iroh otherwise.  Remember that, being both top strategy masters, they will always perform the best possible move each turn.

For , the only possible split is , which violates the first condition. For , there are no possible splits because  only has one digit. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1
__label__Hash-Table You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.   Example: Input: [[0,1,0,0],  [1,1,1,0],  [0,1,0,0],  [1,1,0,0]]  Output: 16  Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
__label__Dynamic-Programming We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated. XX  <- domino  XX  <- "L" tromino X  Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7. (In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.) Example: Input: 3 Output: 5 Explanation:  The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles: XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY Note:  N  will be in range [1, 1000].

__label__Data-Structures __label__Advanced-Data-Structures A cricket match is going to be held. The field is represented by a 1D plane. A cricketer, Mr. X has  favorite shots. Each shot has a particular range. The range of the   shot is from i to i. That means his favorite shot can be anywhere in this range. Each player on the opposite team  can field only in a particular range. Player  can field from i to i. You are given the  favorite shots of Mr. X and the range of  players.  represents the strength of each player i.e. the number of shots player  can stop.  Your task is to find: . Game Rules: A player can stop the  shot if the range overlaps with the player's fielding range.
